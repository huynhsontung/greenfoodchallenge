The user is later then asked to select their gender and initial preset meal plan which the user may adjust more precisely later on.

## Tutorial
Tutorial pop-up will welcome first time users to get them started on how to use the application. Users may revisit the tutorial by clicking on the question mark icon found in each fragment.

## Dashboard Activity
The dashboard provides the user a visual representation of their saved meal plans and its impact on the environment.

The user can alternate between two pie charts by swiping right or left. The blue pie chart indicates the percentage of each portion in the user's diet. The red pie chart indicates how much each portion contributes to the production of CO2e.
The user may change the name of the meal plan by pressing the edit icon.
The user is given the approximate metric tonnes of CO2e created from the selected food plan, as well as the equivalence of an average car drive to produce that amount in kilometers.
The user's current plan is also displayed. 

## Improve Plan
The improve plan feature can be activated by pressing the 'Improve' button seen in the dashboard. A new meal plan that reduces the user's CO2e by 10% is displayed. The new plan is generated by an algorithm that uses a scaling factor to slightly adjusting each food portions, starting with those which produce the most CO2e.
A celebratory toast will be generated to inform the user how much CO2e could be reduced if all of Metro Vancouver were to use the same plan.

The user can save the new plan if they are satisfied by pressing "save" or "save as".
Users may use the sliders to update the amount of CO2e saved in real-time. The pie graph will turn red as a warning indication when the plan being edited has a greater amount of CO2e than the previous plan


## Pledge 
The pledge feature has two fragments. The 'My Pledge' fragment allows users to make a pledge to save a certain amount of CO2e (in kilograms) in a week. The 'Discover' fragment allows users to see other users pledges along with their statistics on the specified pledge. The user may also filter pledges by the municipality.

## Meal Tracker
The meal tracker fragment allows users to explore different green meals posted by other Vancouverites. Users may post their green meal, in which it requires them to enter meal details, and upload a photo.

The database has a record of green restaurants with their menus across Metro Vancouver. Upon specifying items, tags will be set so that meals may be searched by other users.

## Profile
Users may edit their profile by clicking on their information as shown by the images below. In the account information menu, users may change their profile picture.
