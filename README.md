The user is later then asked to select their gender and initial preset meal plan which the user may adjust more precisely later on.

## Tutorial
Tutorial pop-up will welcome first time users to get them started on how to use the application. Users may revisit the tutorial by clicking on the question mark icon found in each fragment.

## Dashboard Activity
The dashboard provides the user a visual representation of their saved meal plans and its impact on the environment.

The user can alternate between two pie charts by swiping right or left. The blue pie chart indicates the percentage of each portion in the user's diet. The red pie chart indicates how much each portion contributes to the production of CO2e.
The user may change the name of the meal plan by pressing the edit icon.
The user is given the approximate metric tonnes of CO2e created from the selected food plan, as well as the equivalence of an average car drive to produce that amount in kilometers.
The user's current plan is also displayed. 

## Improve Plan
The improve plan feature can be activated by pressing the 'Improve' button seen in the dashboard. A new meal plan that reduces the user's CO2e by 10% is displayed. The new plan is generated by an algorithm that uses a scaling factor to slightly adjusting each food portions, starting with those which produce the most CO2e.
A celebratory toast will be generated to inform the user how much CO2e could be reduced if all of Metro Vancouver were to use the same plan.

The user can save the new plan if they are satisfied by pressing "save" or "save as".
Users may use the sliders to update the amount of CO2e saved in real-time. The pie graph will turn red as a warning indication when the plan being edited has a greater amount of CO2e than the previous plan


## Pledge 
The pledge activity has two fragments. The 'My Pledge' fragment allows the user to make a pledge of how many kilograms of CO2 they will commit to saving in a week. The 'Discover' fragment allows the user to see other users and their pledges, as well as various statistics on the pledges. The user may also filter pledges by municipality.

## Meal Tracker
This fragment allows users to explore different green meals posted by other Vancouverites. The user may also upload their own green meal. In doing so, the user is required to enter meal details, and upload a photo.

The database keeps record of green restaurants and their menus across Metro Vancouver. Upon selecting these items, tags will be set, so that the meals may be searched by other users.

## Profile
Users may view their profile. Upon clicking on their information, they can enter a profile account information activity, where the profile picture may be edited.
